### Homework

To get started with JavaScript, you will implement things we learned from the code we went through in class.

Please review our [jsintro/script.js](jsintro/script.js) throughout this assignment, but please do not just copy and paste our code.

#### For each of the following, create a working JavaScript file:

##### `01-stringCompare.js`
Create a conditional statement that checks if two strings are equal. Include an `if` and `else` statement. Create an `alert()` that gives feedback based on the string defined. Test your statement with different strings to make sure both alerts work.

##### `02-numberCompare.js`
Create a conditional statement that compares two numbers. You can choose if those numbers will be equal `==`, less than `<`, greater than `>`, less than or equal to `<=`, or greater than or equal to `>=` each other. Include an `if`, `else if`, and `else` statement. Create an `alert()` that gives feedback based on the number. Test your statement with different numbers to make sure all alerts work.

##### `03-functionCombine.js`
Create a `function` that takes in two arguments and returns a concatenated string in the `console`.

##### `04-functionConditions.js`
Create a `function` that takes in one argument that is passed through a conditional statement. (For example, something like our haunted house `door()` function.) Print some resulting text to the `console`.  Test all of your conditions to make sure you can receive all of your results back.

#### `05-randomWords.js`
Create an `array` of strings and use `random()` to select random entries and add them to a sentence, printing the result to the console.

#### Deliverable format

Create one `index.html`, include the scripts, and send me your **GitHub link** â€“ the page does not need to be shared publicly via Github Pages.

### Review for next week

* Read [What is the Document Object Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-1/introduction.html) and [Eloquent Javascript: The Document Object Model](http://eloquentjavascript.net/14_dom.html)
