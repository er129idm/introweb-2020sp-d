## Day 12

### In-Class

We will start by going around the room and sharing our idea or ideas for the assignment, and give each other feedback.

Afterwards, we will take a look at CSS `grid` before you jump into the http://cssgridgarden.com/ "CSS Grid Garden" assignment.

### Homework

* Complete the CSS Grid Garden exercise, and submit your zipped screenshots to me like you did with Flexbox Froggy: http://cssgridgarden.com/

* Review CSS Tricks' https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ "A Complete Guide to Grid" – This is an ENORMOUSLY helpful resource that you can keep open and reference throughout the process of making a `grid` based layout.

* _Please_ watch the entire https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kVeCqQCxlk "CSS Grid Changes Everything" – they cover many other interesting parts of the system.

* Consider the feedback you received in class about your project proposal. Continue collecting references and moodboarding your idea.

* Begin prototyping or building your project- I _seriously_ recommend leveraging CSS Grid, so experiment with that. We will have an in class work day next class.
