## Final Projects

You are now equipped with the basics of web development, allowing you to build fully functioning, interactive and/or reactive websites. 

Proposal: Good design often solves problems. You are to identify a problem that could benefit from good or better design on the web. There are many ways to approach this! Some examples:

    * An artist who makes work you really admire has a website that looks like it's from 1999, and that is not on purpose. It is difficult to see their work or for potential curators or buyers to get in touch with them because of their website. 
    
    * A nonprofit that helps match owners and pets that were lost during natural disasters does not have a website, making it difficult for people to be aware of their services.
    
    * A product designer is launching a new, innovative product on Kickstarter and needs a website to include on the crowdfunding page so that consumers can see the design process and learn about other products.
    
Your final website project will utilize HTML, CSS, and Javascript (or optional Jquery) to solve this design challenge. 

Your project will be considered complete if you have completed the following:

    1) A comprehensive wireframe
    2) A site map
    3) A moodboard
    4) A website with at least 3 content areas, which could be represented as 3 pages or 3 sections on a one-page website.
    
## Final Project Grading Criteria:

* Student has cohesively prepared a design aesthetic that was pre-planned with a wireframe, moodboard and sitemap.

* Layout is deliberate and easy to follow for the user.

* All code is properly formatted, linked properly, and works toward your intention.

* Website has been presented in a formal presentation that shows design process, website and code. (6 minutes will be allowed for presentation with 3 minutes for clarifying questions and feedback.)

* NOTE: Projects must be pushed to Github/Github Pages. They must be submitted via NYU Classes by May 7, regardless of the day you are scheduled to present. There will be no extensions on final projects.

Final Presentations: Think of this like a pitch for your idea. In your presentation, you should a) tell us what you made and WHY it was necessary you make it, b) demo your website, c) highlight key features in your code. You should show any supporting materials necessary to tell a story about why this site needed to be built.
