## Day 6

* In class demonstration of the concepts we covered last class

* Prototype / Sketch review

### Homework

* For next class complete your three page website on the _important issue you care about_, focusing on structural layout and navigation using DIVs.

* While this site doesn't _need_ to read like a wikipedia article, and you can be creative, you must clearly communicate some perspective or detail about the issue you have chosen.

* This is a three page website with some kind of navigation that carries through across all three pages.

* As alwaysâ€“ strive to make something you are proud of.

### Post-Class Communique

Hi class!

Just wanted to check in with the URL of today's in class demo: https://github.com/er129idm/introweb-2020sp-d/tree/master/class-06/classdemo/catspage

And to check in about the goals of your assignment:

== Building a 3 Page Website about an Issue ==

- Sketching your mockup or "wireframe" to think about a project as a whole
- Using DIVs to structure the layout of your site, making use of `display`, and `position` to bring your wireframe to life.
- Come up with a coherent way to navigate the three sections of your page, depending on your overall design goal.

- Present your topic in a way that effectively communicates a perspective, or some educational insight into the issue you chose.
  - This could mean designing in a way that is very specific, informational, editorial, design oriented, or...
  - if you choose to pursue something more abstract, satirical, visual... think about how you can push those choices in a way that is most effecting to your viewer, or communicative of your perspective.

- When establishing the "design language" of your site through the specific choice of fonts, colors, spacing, and content:
  - Think about the ways you are employing Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity to best effect.

Please feel free to email me if you wanted any feedback on implementing any suggestions I made to your theme or layout, or, if you run into any major issues implementing your design in code- you can send me your code to be reviewed.

Thanks!
